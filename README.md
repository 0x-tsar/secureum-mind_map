**All information was original created by** [0xRajeev](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev) that he has developed from other public sources. This content is based upon the Secureum Epoch0 Bootcamp for Smart Contract auditng.

The plan is to grow this over time. Pull requests accepted.

Sections/information I would like to add (my wish list): 
- Slide screenshots for each topic.
- The time in the youtube video that the topic is discussed.
- Links to the relevant topic on youtube.
- Text to speech of what is said for each topic.
- Add dapptool examples for relevant sections.

The impetus for this project is both self-edification as well as enabling accessibility to the content [0xRajeev](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev) has produced. Also, I really just wanted to make some cool graphs. :)

Currently, I have copied over the slide text as well as the relavent section from the blog.

If you open this in [Obsidian](https://obisidian.md) you can graph the notes.
