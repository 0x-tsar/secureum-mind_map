# 97 - [Import upgradeable contracts in proxy-based upgradeable contracts](Import%20upgradeable%20contracts%20in%20proxy-based%20upgradeable%20contracts.md)
Contracts imported from proxy-based upgradeable contracts should also be upgradeable where such contracts have been modified to use initializers instead of constructors. (see [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#use-upgradeable-libraries))
