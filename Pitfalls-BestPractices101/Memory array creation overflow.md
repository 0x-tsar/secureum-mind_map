# 92 - [Memory array creation overflow](Memory%20array%20creation%20overflow.md)
The creation of very large memory arrays can result in overlapping memory regions and thus memory corruption. This is due to a compiler bug introduced in _v0.2.0_ and fixed in _v0.6.5_. (see [here](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug/))
