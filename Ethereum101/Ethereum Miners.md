# 47 - [Ethereum Miners](Ethereum%20Miners.md)

Miners are entities running Ethereum nodes that validate and execute these transactions and combine them into blocks. 

The process of validating each block by having a miner provide a mathematical proof is known as a “proof of work.” 

Miners are rewarded for blocks accepted into the blockchain with a block reward in ether (currently 2 ETH). 

A miner also gets fees which is the ether spent on gas by all the transactions included in the block.
