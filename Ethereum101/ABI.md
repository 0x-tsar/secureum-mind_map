# 81 - [ABI](ABI.md)
The Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction.

1.  Â Interface functions of a contract are strongly typed, known at compilation time and static.

2.  Contracts will have the interface definitions of any contracts they call available at compile-time.
