# 88 - [Web3](Web3.md)

Web3 is a permissionless, trust-minimized and censorship-resistant network for transfer of value and information. 

1.  The popular approach to realise Web3 is to build it over a foundation of peer-to-peer network of nodes for compute, communication and storage. 
    
2.  In the Ethereum ecosystem, this is a combination of the Ethereum blockchain, Waku (previously Whisper) and Swarm respectively. 
    
3.  Privacy and anonymity are big motivating factors in Web3.
    
4.  Most of the foundational security design principles and development practices from Web2 still apply to Web3. But Web3 security is indeed a paradigm shift along many frontiers.
