# 94 - [Architecture, Language, & Tools](Architecture,%20Language,%20&%20Tools.md)

New Architecture, Language & Toolchains: Ethereum has a new virtual machine ([EVM](EVM.md)) architecture which is a stack-based machine with 256-bit words and associated gas semantics. 

1.  [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/) language continues to dominate [smart contracts](Smart%20Contracts.md) without much real competition (except Vyper perhaps). 
    
2.  The associated toolchains which include development environments (e.g. [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [Brownie](https://www.browniesuite.com/en/p/homepage), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)), libraries (e.g. https://openzeppelin.com/), security tools (e.g. [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither), [MythX](https://mythx.io/), [Securify](https://www.securify.nl)) and wallets (e.g. Metamask) are maturing but still playing catch up to the exponential growth of the space.
