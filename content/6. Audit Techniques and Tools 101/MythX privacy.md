MythX privacy guarantee for the smart contract code submitted using their SaaS APIs:


1.  Code analysis requests are encrypted with TLS
2.  To provide comprehensive reports and improve performance, it stores some of the contract data in our database, including parts of the source code and bytecode but that data never leaves their secure server and is not shared with any outside parties.Â 
3.  It keeps the results of your analysis so you can retrieve them later, but the report can be accessed by you only.
