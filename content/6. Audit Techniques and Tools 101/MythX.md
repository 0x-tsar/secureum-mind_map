[MythX](https://mythx.io/) is a powerful security analysis service that finds Solidity vulnerabilities in your Ethereum smart contract code during your development life cycle. 

It is a [paid API-based service](https://mythx.io/plans/) which uses [several tools](https://mythx.io/tools/) on the backend including a static analyzer (Maru), symbolic analyzer (Mythril) and a greybox fuzzer (Harvey) to implement a total of [46 detectors](https://mythx.io/detectors/). 

[Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) is the open-source component of MythX.
