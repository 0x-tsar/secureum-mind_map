Evaluating data flow Data flow analyzes the transfer of data across and within smart contracts


1.  Interprocedural data flow is evaluated by analyzing the data (variables/constants) used as argument values for function parameters at call sites
2.  Intraprocedural data flow is evaluated by analyzing the assignment and use of (state/memory/calldata) variables/constants along the control flow paths within functions.
3.  Both intra and interprocedural data flow analysis help track the flow of global/local storage/memory changes in smart contracts
