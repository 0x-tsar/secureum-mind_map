Audit Checklist For Projects (See [here](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/04/06/how-to-prepare-for-a-security-audit/) for Trail of Bits recommendations):

1. Resolve the easy issues: 
	1. Enable and address every last compiler warning 
	2. Increase unit and feature test coverage
	3. Remove dead code, stale branches, unused libraries, and other extraneous weight.
2. Document:
	1. Describe what your product does, who uses it, why, and how it delivers.
	2. Add comments about intended behavior in-line with the code.
	3. Label and describe your tests and results, both positive and negative. 
	4. Include past reviews and bugs.
3. Deliver the code batteries included:
	1. Document the steps to create a build environment from scratch on a computer that is fully disconnected from your internal network
	2. Include external dependencies 
	3. Document the build process, including debugging and the test environment 
	4. Document the deployment process and environment, including all the specific versions of external tools and libraries for this process.
