Exploits are incidents where vulnerabilities are triggered by malicious actors to misuse smart contracts resulting, for example, in stolen/frozen assetsÂ 

1. Presenting proof-of-concepts of such exploits either in code or written descriptions of hypothetical scenarios make audit findings more realistic and relatable by illustrating specific exploit paths and justifying severity of findings
2. Codified exploits should always be on a testnet, kept private and responsibly disclosed to project teams without any risk of being actually executed on live systems resulting in real loss of funds or access
3. Descriptive exploit scenarios should make realistic assumptions on roles/powers of actors, practical reasons for their actions and sequencing of events that trigger vulnerabilities and illustrate the paths to exploitation
