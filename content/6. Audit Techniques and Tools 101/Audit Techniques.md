Audit Techniques involve a combination of different methods that are applied to the project codebase with accompanying specification and documentation. 

Many are automated analyses performed with tools and some require manual assistance.
1. Specification analysis (manual)
2. Documentation analysis (manual)
3. Testing (automated)
4. Static analysis (automated)
5. Fuzzing (automated)
6. Symbolic checking (automated)
7. Formal verification (automated)
8. Manual analysis (manual)

One may also think of these as manual/semi-automated/fully-automated, where the distinction between semi-automated and fully-automated is the difference between a tool that requires a user to define properties versus a tool that requires (almost) no user configuration except to triage results. 

Fully-automated tools tend to be straightforward to use, while semi-automated tools require some human assistance and are therefore more resource-expensive.
