VerX [VerX](https://verx.ch/): is a verifier that can automatically prove temporal safety properties of Ethereum smart contracts. The verifier is based on a careful combination of three ideas: reduction of temporal safety verification to reachability checking, an efficient symbolic execution engine used to compute precise symbolic states within a transaction, and delayed abstraction which approximates symbolic states at the end of transactions into abstract states.Â
