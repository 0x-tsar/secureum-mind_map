VerX [VerX](https://verx.ch/): is a verifier that can automatically prove temporal safety properties of Ethereum smart contracts. 

The verifier is based on a careful combination of three ideas: 
1. Reduction of temporal safety verification to reachability checking
2. An efficient symbolic execution engine used to compute precise symbolic states within a transaction
3. Delayed abstraction which approximates symbolic states at the end of transactions into abstract states.Â
