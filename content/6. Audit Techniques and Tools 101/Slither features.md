Slither features:

1. Detects vulnerable Solidity code with low false positives
2. Identifies where the error condition occurs in the source code
3. Easily integrates into continuous integration and Truffle builds
4. Built-in 'printers' quickly report crucial contract information
5. Detector API to write custom analyses in Python
6. Ability to analyze contracts written with Solidity >= 0.4
7. Intermediate representation (SlithIR) enables simple, high-precision analyses
8. Correctly parses 99.9% of all public Solidity code
9. Average execution time of less than 1 second per contract
