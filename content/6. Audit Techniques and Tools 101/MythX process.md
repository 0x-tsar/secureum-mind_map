MythX process


1.  Submit your code: The analysis requests are encrypted with TLS and the code you submit is accessed only by you. Submit both the source code and the compiled bytecode of your smart contracts for best results.
2.  Activate a full suite of analysis techniques: The longer MythX runs, the more it can detect more security weaknesses.
3.  Receive a detailed analysis report: MythX detects a majority of vulnerabilities listed in the SWC Registry. The report will return a listing of all the weaknesses found in your code, including the exact position of the issue and its SWC ID. Reports generated can be only accessed by you. MythX offers 3 scan modes, quick, standard and deep. You can see the differences here.
