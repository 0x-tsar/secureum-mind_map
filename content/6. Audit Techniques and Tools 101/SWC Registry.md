[SWC Registry](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry): The Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry (SWC Registry) is an implementation of the weakness classification scheme proposed in EIP-1470.Â 

1. It is loosely aligned to the terminologies and structure used in the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) while overlaying a wide range of weakness variants that are specific to smart contracts
2. The goals of this project are as follows: 1) Provide a straightforward way to classify security issues in smart contract systems. 2) Define a common language for describing security issues in smart contract systems' architecture, design, or code. 3) Serve as a way to train and increase performance for smart contract security analysis tools.
3. This repository is maintained by the team behind MythX and currently contains 37 entries
