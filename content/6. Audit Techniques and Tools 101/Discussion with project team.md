# 86 - [Discussion with project team](./Discussion%20with%20project%20team.md)

Discussion with project team Having an open communication channel with the project team is  useful to clarify any assumptions in specification, documentation, implementation, or discuss interim findings.


1.  Findings may also be shared with the project team immediately on a private repository to discuss impact, fixes and other implications.
2.  If the audit spans multiple weeks, it may help to have a weekly sync up call. A counterpoint to this is to independently perform the entire assessment so as to not get biased by the project team’s inputs and opinions.
