Fuzzing [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks 


1.  Fuzzing is especially relevant to smart contracts because anyone can interact with them on the blockchain with random inputs without necessarily having a valid reason or expectation (arbitrary byzantine behaviour)
2.  [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and [Harvey](https://mariachris.github.io/Pubs/FSE-2020-Harvey.pdf) are two popular tools for smart contract fuzzing
