Capture the Flag (CTF) are fun and educational challenges where participants have to hack different (dummy) smart contracts that have vulnerabilities in them. They help understand the complexities around how vulnerabilities may be exploited in the wild. 

Popular ones include:

1. [Capture The Ether](https://capturetheether.com/): is a set of twenty challenges created by [Steve Marx](https://twitter.com/smarx) which test knowledge of Ethereum concepts of contracts, accounts and math among other things.
2. [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/): is a Web3/Solidity based war game from OpenZeppelin that is played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be â€˜hacked'. The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players
