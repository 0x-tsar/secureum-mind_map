# 88 - [Report delivery](./Report%20delivery.md)

The delivery of the report to the project team is a critical deliverable and milestone. 

Unless interim findings/status is shared, this will be the first time the project team will have access to the assessment details.

1. The delivery typically happens via a shared online document and is accompanied with a readout where the auditors present the report highlights to the project team for discussion and any debate on findings and their severity ratings
2. The project team typically takes some time to review the audit report and respond back with any counterpoints on findings, severities or suggested fixes
3. Depending on the prior agreement, the project team and audit firm might release the audit report publicly (after all required fixes have been made) or the project may decide to keep it private for some reason
