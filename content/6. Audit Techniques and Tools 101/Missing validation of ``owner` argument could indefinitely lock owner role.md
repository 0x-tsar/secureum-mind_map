 A lack of input validation of the `_owner` argument in both the constructor and `setOwner` functions could permanently lock the owner role, requiring a costly redeploy. To resolve an incorrect owner issue, Uniswap would need to redeploy the factory contract and re-add pairs and liquidity. Users might not be happy to learn of these actions, which could lead to reputational damage. Certain users could also decide to continue using the original factory and pair contracts, in which owner functions cannot be called. This could lead to the concurrent use of two versions of Uniswap, one with the original factory contract and no valid owner and another in which the owner was set correctly. Trail of Bits identified four distinct cases in which an incorrect owner is set: 1) Passing address(0) to the constructor 2) Passing address(0) to the `setOwner` function 3) Passing an incorrect address to the constructor 4)Â  Passing an incorrect address to the `setOwner` function.
