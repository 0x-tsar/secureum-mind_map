Audit Limitations Audits are necessary (for now at least) but not sufficient:
1. There is risk reduction but residual risk exists because of several factors such as limited amount of audit time/effort, limited insights into project specification/implementation, limited security expertise in the new and fast evolving technologies, limited audit scope, significant project complexity and limitations of automated/manual analysis.
2. Not all audits are equal — it greatly depends on the expertise/experience of auditors, effort invested vis-a-vis project complexity/quality and tools/processes used.
3. Audits provide a project’s security snapshot over a brief (typically few weeks) period. However, smart contracts need to evolve over time to add new features, fix bugs or optimize. Relying on external audits after every change is impractical.
