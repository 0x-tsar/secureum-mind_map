Manual analysis is complimentary to automated analysis using tools and serves a critical need in smart contract audits

1. Automated analysis using tools is cheap (typically open-source free software), fast, deterministic and scalable (varies depending on the tool being semi-/fully-automated) but however is only as good as the properties it is made aware of, which is typically limited to Solidity and EVM related constraints
2. Manual analysis with humans, in contrast, is expensive, slow, non-deterministic and not scalable because human expertise in smart contact security is a rare/expensive skill set today and we are slower, prone to error and inconsistent.
3. Manual analysis is however the only way today to infer and evaluate business logic and application-level constraints which is where a majority of the serious vulnerabilities are being found.
