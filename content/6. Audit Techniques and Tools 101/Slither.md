Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. 

It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses. 

Slither enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses. 

It implements [74 detectors](https://github.com/crytic/slither#detectors) in the publicly available free version (with [trophies](https://github.com/crytic/slither/blob/master/trophies.md) that showcase Slither findings in real-world contracts). [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)
