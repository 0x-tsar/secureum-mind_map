Brainstorming with other auditors [Linus’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's`law): ”Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” might apply with auditors too if they brainstorm on the smart contract implementation, assumptions, findings and vulnerabilities.
1. While some audit firms encourage active/passive discussion, there are others whose approach is to let auditors separately perform the assessment to encourage independent thinking instead of group thinking. The premise is that group thinking might bias the audit team to focus on certain aspects while missing some vulnerabilities.
2. A hybrid approach might be interesting where the audit team initially brainstorms to discuss the project’s goals, specification/documentation and implementation but later firewall themselves to independently pursue the assessments and finally come together to compile their findings.
