Fuzzing-as-a-Service [Fuzzing-as-a-Service](https://consensys.net/diligence/fuzzing/): is a service recently launched by ConsenSys Diligence where projects can submit their smart contracts along with embedded inlined specifications or properties written using the Scribble language. These contracts are run through the Harvey fuzzer which uses the specified properties to optimize fuzzing campaigns. Any violations from fuzzing are reported back from the service for the project to fix.
