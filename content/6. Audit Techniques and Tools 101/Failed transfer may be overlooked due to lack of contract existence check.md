 Because the pool fails to check that a contract exists, the pool may assume that failed transactions involving destructed tokens are successful. `TransferHelper.safeTransfer` performs a transfer with a low-level call without confirming the contractâ€™s existence. As a result, if the tokens have not yet been deployed or have been destroyed, safeTransfer will return success even though no transfer was executed.
