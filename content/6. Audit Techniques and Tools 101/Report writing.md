The audit report is a final compilation of the entire assessment and presents all aspects of the audit including the audit scope/coverage, timeline, team/effort, summaries, tools/techniques, findings, exploit scenarios, suggested fixes, short-/long-term recommendations and any appendices with further details on tools and rationale.

1. An executive summary typically gives an overview of the audit report with highlights/lowlights illustrating the number/type/severity of vulnerabilities found and an overall assessment of risk. It may also include a description of the smart contracts, (inferred) actors, assets, roles, permissions, access control, interactions, threat model and existing risk mitigation measures
2. The bulk of the report focuses on the findings from the audit, their type/category, likelihood/impact, severity, justifications for these ratings, potential exploit scenarios, affected parts of smart contracts and potential remediations
3. It may also address subjective aspects of code quality, readability/auditability and other software-engineering best practices related to documentation, code structure, function/variable naming conventions, test coverage etc. that do not pose an imminent security risk but are indicators of anti-patterns and processes influencing the introduction and persistence of security vulnerabilities
