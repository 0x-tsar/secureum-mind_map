# 146 - [Arithemtic Check](Arithemtic%20Check.md)
Overflow/Underflow Check: Until Solidity version 0.8.0 which introduced checked arithmetic by default, arithmetic was unchecked and therefore susceptible to overflows and underflows which could lead to critical vulnerabilities. 

The recommended best-practice for such contracts is to use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeMath library for arithmetic.
