Static analysis is a technique of analyzing program properties without actually executing the program.Â 

1.  This is in contrast to software testing where programs are actually executed/run with different inputs
2.  For smart contracts, static analysis can be performed on the Solidity code or on the EVM bytecode. [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) performs static analysis at the Solidity level while [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) analyzes EVM bytecode.
3.  Static analysis typically is a combination of control flow and data flow analyses
