Evaluating Control flow analyzes the transfer of control, i.e. execution order, across and within smart contracts.Â 

1.  Interprocedural (procedure is just another name for a function) control flow is typically indicated by a call graph which shows which functions (callers) call which other functions (callees), across or within smart contracts
2.  Intraprocedural (i.e. within a function) control flow is dictated by conditionals (if/else), loops (for/while/do/continue/break) and return statements.
3.  Both intra and interprocedural control flow analysis help track the flow of execution and data in smart contracts
