Audit Types depend on the scope/nature/status of projects but generally fall into the following categories:


1.  New audit: for a new project that is being launched
2.  Repeat audit: for a new version of an existing project being revised with new/fixed features
3.  Fix audit: for reviewing the fixes made to the findings from a current/prior audit
4.  Retainer audit: for constantly reviewing project updates
5.  Incident audit: for reviewing an exploit incident, root causing the incident, identifying the underlying vulnerabilities and proposing fixes.
