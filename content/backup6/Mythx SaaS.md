MythX is based on a SaaS (Security as a Service) platform based on the premise that:

1.  Higher performance compared to running security tools locally
2.  Higher vulnerability coverage than any standalone toolÂ 
3.  Benefit from continuous improvements to our security analysis technology with new and improved security tests as the smart contract security landscape evolves.
