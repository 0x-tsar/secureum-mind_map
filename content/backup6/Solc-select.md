[Solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) is a script to quickly switch between Solidity compiler versions.Â 


1.  solc-select: manages installing and setting different solc compiler versions
2.  solc: wrapper around solc which picks the right version according to what was set via solc-select
3.  solc binaries are downloaded from https://binaries.soliditylang.org/ which contains official artifacts for many historical and modern solc versions for Linux and macOS
