# 194 - [Principle of Least Common Mechanism](Principle%20of%20Least%20Common%20Mechanism.md)
“Minimize the amount of mechanism common to more than one user and depended on by all users” — Ensure that only the least number of security-critical modules/paths as required are shared amongst the different actors/code so that impact from any vulnerability/compromise in shared components is limited and contained to the smallest possible subset. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
