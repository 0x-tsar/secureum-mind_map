# 160 - [Trusted actors](Trusted%20actors.md)
Ideally there should be no trusted actors while interacting with smart contracts. 

However, in guarded launch scenarios, the goal is to start with trusted actors and then progressively decentralise towards automated governance by community/DAO. 

For the trusted phase, all the trusted actors, their roles and capabilities should be clearly specified, implemented accordingly and documented for user information and examination.
