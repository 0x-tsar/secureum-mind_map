# 201 - [Principle of Compromise Recording](Principle%20of%20Compromise%20Recording.md)
“Mechanisms that reliably record that a compromise of information has occurred can be used in place of more elaborate mechanisms that completely prevent loss” — Ensure that smart contracts and their accompanying operational infrastructure can be monitored/analyzed at all times (development/deployment/runtime) for minimizing loss from any compromise due to vulnerabilities/exploits. For e.g., critical operations in contracts should necessarily emit events to facilitate monitoring at runtime. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
