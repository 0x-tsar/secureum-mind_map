# 108 - [Token Inflation via interest](Token%20Inflation%20via%20interest.md)
Potential interest earned from the token should be taken into account. Some tokens distribute interest to token holders. This interest might be trapped in the contract if not taken into account. (See [here](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/blob/master/development-guidelines/token_integration.md#erc-conformity))
