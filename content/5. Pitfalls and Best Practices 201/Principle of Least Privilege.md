# 192 - [Principle of Least Privilege](Principle%20of%20Least%20Privilege.md)
“Every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job” — Ensure that various system actors have the least amount of privilege granted as required by their roles to execute their specified tasks. Granting excess privilege is prone to misuse/abuse when trusted actors misbehave or their access is hijacked by malicious entities. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
