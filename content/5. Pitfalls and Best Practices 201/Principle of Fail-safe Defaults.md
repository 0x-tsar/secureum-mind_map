# 195 - [Principle of Fail-safe Defaults](Principle%20of%20Fail-safe%20Defaults.md)
“Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion” — Ensure that variables or permissions are initialized to fail-safe default values which can be made more inclusive later instead of opening up the system to everyone including untrusted actors. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
