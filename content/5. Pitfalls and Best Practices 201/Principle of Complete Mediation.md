# 196 - [Principle of Complete Mediation](Principle%20of%20Complete%20Mediation.md)
 “Every access to every object must be checked for authority.” — Ensure that any required access control is enforced along all access paths to the object or function being protected. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
