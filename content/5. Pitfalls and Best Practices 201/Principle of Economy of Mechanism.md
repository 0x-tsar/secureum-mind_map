# 197 - [Principle of Economy of Mechanism](Principle%20of%20Economy%20of%20Mechanism.md)
“Keep the design as simple and small as possible” — Ensure that contracts and functions are not overly complex or large so as to reduce readability or maintainability. 

Complexity typically leads to insecurity. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
