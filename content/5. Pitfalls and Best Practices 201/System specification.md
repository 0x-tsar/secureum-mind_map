# 136 - [System specification](System%20specification.md)
Ensure that the specification of the entire system is considered, written and evaluated to the greatest detail possible. Specification describes how (and why) the different components of the system behave to achieve the design requirements. Without specification, a system implementation cannot be evaluated against the requirements for correctness.
