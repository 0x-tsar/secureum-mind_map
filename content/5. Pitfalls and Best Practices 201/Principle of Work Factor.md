# 200 - [Principle of Work Factor](Principle%20of%20Work%20Factor.md)
“Compare the cost of circumventing the mechanism with the resources of a potential attacker” — Given the magnitude of value managed by smart contracts, it is safe to assume that byzantine attackers will risk the greatest amounts of intellectual/financial/social capital possible to subvert such systems. Therefore, the mitigation mechanisms must factor in the highest levels of risk. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
