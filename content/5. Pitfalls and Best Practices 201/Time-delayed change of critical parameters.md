# 163 - [Time-delayed change of critical parameters](Time-delayed%20change%20of%20critical%20parameters.md)
When critical parameters of systems need to be changed, it is required to broadcast the change via event emission and recommended to enforce the changes after a time-delay. 

This is to allow system users to be aware of such critical changes and give them an opportunity to exit or adjust their engagement with the system accordingly. 

For e.g. reducing the rewards or increasing the fees in a system might not be acceptable to some users who may wish to withdraw their funds and exit.
