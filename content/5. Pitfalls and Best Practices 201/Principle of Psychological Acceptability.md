# 199 - [Principle of Psychological Acceptability](Principle%20of%20Psychological%20Acceptability.md)
“It is essential that the human interface be designed for ease of use, so that users routinely and automatically apply the protection mechanisms correctly” — Ensure that security aspects of smart contract interfaces and system designs/flows are user-friendly and intuitive so that users can interact with minimal risk. (See [Saltzer and Schroeder's Secure Design Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder's_design_principles))
