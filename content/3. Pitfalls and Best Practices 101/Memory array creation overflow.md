# 92 - [Memory array creation overflow](Memory%20array%20creation%20overflow.md)
The creation of very large memory arrays can result in overlapping memory regions and thus memory corruption. This is due to a compiler bug introduced in `v0.2.0` and fixed in `v0.6.5`. (see [here](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/04/06/memory-creation-overflow-bug/))
