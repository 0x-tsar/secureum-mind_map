# 95 - [Byzantine Threat Model](Byzantine%20Threat%20Model.md)

Byzantine Threat Model: The [Web3](Web3.md) threat model is based on byzantine faults dealing with arbitrary malicious behavior and governed by mechanism design.Â 
1. Given the aspirational absence of trusted intermediaries, everyone and everything is meant to be untrusted by default. Participants in this model include developers, miners/validators, [infrastructure](Infrastructure.md) providers and users, all of whom could potentially be adversaries.
2. This is a fundamentally different threat model from that of Web2 where there are generalized notions of trusted insiders with authorized access to resources/assets that have to be protected against untrusted outsiders (and malicious insiders). Web3 is the ultimate zero-trust scenario.
