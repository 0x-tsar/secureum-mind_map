# 59 - [EVM Architecture](EVM%20Architecture.md)

The [EVM](EVM.md) is a simple stack-based architecture consisting of the stack, volatile memory, non-volatile storage with a word size of 256-bit (chosen to facilitate the [Keccak256](Keccak256.md) hash scheme and elliptic-curve computations) and [Calldata](Calldata.md).
