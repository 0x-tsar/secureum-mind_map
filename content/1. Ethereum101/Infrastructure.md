Ethereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a [Byzantine Threat Model](Byzantine%20Threat%20Model.md)cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs. It is often described as "the world computer.”
