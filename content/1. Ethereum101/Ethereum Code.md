# 58 - [Ethereum Code](Ethereum%20Code.md)

The code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as "Ethereum virtual machine code" or "[EVM](EVM.md) code". 

The code consists of a series of bytes (hence called bytecode), where each byte represents an operation.
