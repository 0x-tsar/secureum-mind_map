# 92 - [Unstoppable & Immutable](Unstoppable%20&%20Immutable.md)

Unstoppable & Immutable: [Web3](Web3.md) applications, popularly known as Decentralized Applications ( [ÐApps](Dapp.md)), are expected to be unstoppable and immutable because they run on a decentralized blockchain network. 

1. There should not be any one entity that can unilaterally decide to stop a running  [ÐApp](Dapp.md) or make changes to it. Transactions and data on the blockchain are guaranteed to be immutable unless a majority of the network decides otherwise. 
    
2. [Smart contracts](Smart%20Contracts.md), in general, are expected (by users) to not have kill switches controlled by deployers. They are also expected to not be arbitrarily upgradeable. Both these stem from the [Web3](Web3.md) goal of trust-minimization, i.e. lack of need to trust potentially malicious  ÐApp developers. However, this makes fixing security vulnerabilities in deployed code and responding to exploits very challenging.

## Slide Text
- [ÐApps](Dapp.md) -> Decentralized Infrastructure & Governance
- No single entity -> Can stop/change Dapp/Infra/Gov
- Contract Owners-> Should not be able to change/stop/upgrade or kill
- Harder -> Fixing vulnerabilities or incident response
