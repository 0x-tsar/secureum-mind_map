# 91 - [Open-Source & Transparent](Open-Source%20&%20Transparent.md)

Open-source & Transparent: Given the emphasis on trust-minimization, [Web3](Web3.md) software, especially smart contracts, are expected to be open-source by default. 

1. The deployed bytecode is also expected to be source code verified (on a service such as Etherscan). Security by obscurity with proprietary code is not part of Web3's ethos.

2. All interactions with smart contracts are recorded on the blockchain as transactions. This includes the transactions’ senders, data and outcome. Having complete visibility into the entire history of transactions and state transitions is akin to having a publicly accessible audit log of a system since inception. 

3. Furthermore, transactions that are still “in flight” and are yet to be confirmed on the blockchain are also publicly visible in pending transaction queues (i.e. mempools) and lend to front-running attacks.
