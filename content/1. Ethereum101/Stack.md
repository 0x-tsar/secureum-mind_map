# 60 - [Stack](Stack.md)

Stack is made up of 1024 256-bit elements. EVM instructions can operate with the top 16 stack elements. 

Most [EVM](EVM.md) [instructions](Instruction%20Set.md) operate with the stack (stack-based architecture) and there are also stack-specific operations e.g. PUSH, POP, SWAP, DUP etc.
