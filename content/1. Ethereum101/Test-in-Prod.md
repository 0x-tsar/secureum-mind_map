# 99 - [Test-in-Prod](Test-in-Prod.md)

Test-in-Prod: A combination of compressed [timescale](Timescale.md), unrestricted [composability](Composability.md), [Byzantine Threat Model](Byzantine%20Threat%20Model.md) and challenges of replicating full state for predicting failure modes of interacting components built with rapidly evolving experimental software/tools in many ways forces realistic testing to happen only in production, i.e. on the “mainnet”. This implies that complex technical and cryptoeconomic exploits may only be discoverable upon production deployment.
