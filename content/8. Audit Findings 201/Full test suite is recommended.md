Full test suite is recommended The test suite at this stage is not complete and many of the tests fail to execute. 

For complicated systems such as DeFi Saver, which uses many different modules and interacts with different DeFi protocols, it is crucial to have a full test coverage that includes the edge cases and failed scenarios. 

Especially this helps with safer future development and upgrading each module. 

As we've seen in some smart contract incidents, a complete test suite can prevent issues that might be hard to find with manual reviews.

### Recommendation:
Add a full coverage test suite.
