Lack of contract documentation makes codebase difficult to understand The codebase lacks code documentation, high-level descriptions, and examples, making the contracts difficult to review and increasing the likelihood of user mistakes. The documentation would benefit from more detail.


1. Recommendation: Short term, review and properly document the above mentioned aspects of the codebase. Long term, consider writing a formal specification of the protocol.
