# 163 - [Lack of contract documentation makes codebase difficult to understand](./Lack%20of%20contract%20documentation%20makes%20codebase%20difficult%20to%20understand.md)

The codebase lacks code documentation, high-level descriptions, and examples, making the contracts difficult to review and increasing the likelihood of user mistakes. 

The documentation would benefit from more detail.

### Recommendation:
Short term, review and properly document the above mentioned aspects of the codebase. 

Long term, consider writing a formal specification of the protocol.
