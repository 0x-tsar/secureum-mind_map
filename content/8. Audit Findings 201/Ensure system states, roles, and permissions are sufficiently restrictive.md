# 120 - [Ensure system states, roles, and permissions are sufficiently restrictive](./Ensure%20system%20states,%20roles,%20and%20permissions%20are%20sufficiently%20restrictive.md)

Smart contract code should strive to be strict. 

Strict code behaves predictably, is easier to maintain, and increases a system's ability to handle nonideal conditions. 

Our assessment of Growth DeFi found that many of its states, roles, and permissions are loosely defined.

### Recommendation:
Document the use of administrator permissions. 

Monitor the usage of administrator permissions. 

Specify strict operation requirements for each contract.
