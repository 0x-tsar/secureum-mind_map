Evaluate all tokens prior to inclusion in the system Review current and future tokens in the system for non-standard behavior. Particularly dangerous functionality to look for includes a callback (ie. ERC777) which would enable an attacker to execute potentially arbitrary code during the transaction, fees on transfers, or inflationary/deflationary tokens.


1. Recommendation: Evaluate all tokens prior to inclusion in the system
