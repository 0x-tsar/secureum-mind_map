# 133 - [Address codebase fragility](./Address%20codebase%20fragility.md)

Software is considered "fragile" when issues or changes in one part of the system can have side-effects in conceptually unrelated parts of the codebase. 

Fragile software tends to break easily and may be challenging to maintain.
### Recommendation:
Building an anti-fragile system requires careful thought and consideration outside of the scope of this review. 

In general, prioritize the following concepts: 
1. Follow the single-responsibility principle of functions 
2. Reduce reliance on external systems
