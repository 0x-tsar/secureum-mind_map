# 161 - [Insufficient testing](./Insufficient%20testing.md)

Insufficient testing The repositories under review lack appropriate testing, which increases the likelihood of errors in the development process and makes the code more difficult to review.


1. Recommendation: Short term, ensure that the unit tests cover all public functions at least once, as well as all known corner cases. Long term, integrate coverage analysis tools into the development process and regularly review the coverage.
