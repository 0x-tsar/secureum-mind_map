# 197 - [Mismatches between contracts and interfaces](./Mismatches%20between%20contracts%20and%20interfaces.md)

Mismatches between contracts and interfaces Interfaces define the exposed functionality of the implemented contracts. 

However, in several interfaces there are functions from the counterpart contracts that are not defined.

### Recommendation:
Consider applying the necessary changes in the mentioned interfaces and contracts so that definitions and implementations fully match.
