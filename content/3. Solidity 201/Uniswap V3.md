Uniswap V3: [Introduces](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/)

1. Concentrated liquidity: giving individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against
    
2. Multiple fee tiers: allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk
    
3. V3 oracles are capable of providing time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) on demand for any period within the last ~9 days. This removes the need for integrators to checkpoint historical values.
