# 117 - [Structs & Arrays](Structs%20&%20Arrays.md)
Storage Layout & Structs/Arrays:Â 
    
1. Structs and array data always start a new slot and their items are packed tightly according to these rules

2. Items following [struct](../2.%20Solidity%20101/Structs.md) or [array](../2.%20Solidity%20101/Arrays.md) data always start a new storage slot

1. The elements of structs and arrays are stored after each other, just as if they were given as individual values.
