Chainlink Oracles & Price Feeds: Chainlink Price Feeds provide aggregated data (via its `AggregatorV3Interface` contract interface) from various high quality data providers, fed on-chain by decentralized oracles on the Chainlink Network. 

To get price data into smart contracts for an asset that isnâ€™t covered by an existing price feed, such as the price of a particular stock, one can customize Chainlink oracles to call any external API.
