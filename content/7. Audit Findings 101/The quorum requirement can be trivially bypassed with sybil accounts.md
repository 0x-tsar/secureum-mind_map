 While the final vote on a proposal is determined via a token-weighted vote, the quorum check in the `evaluateProposalOutcome` function can be trivially bypassed by splitting oneâ€™s tokens over multiple accounts and voting with each of the accounts. Each of these sybil votes increases the `proposals[`proposalId].numVotes` variable. This means anyone can make the quorum check pass.
