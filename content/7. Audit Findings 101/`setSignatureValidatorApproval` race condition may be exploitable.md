# 63 - [`setSignatureValidatorApproval` race condition may be exploitable](./`setSignatureValidatorApproval`%20race%20condition%20may%20be%20exploitable.md)

`setSignatureValidatorApproval` race condition may be exploitable If a validator is compromised, a race condition in the signature validator approval logic becomes exploitable. The `setSignatureValidatorApproval` function (Figure 4.1) allows users to delegate the signature validation to a contract. However, if the validator is compromised, a race condition in this function could allow an attacker to validate any amount of malicious transactions.


1. Recommendation: Short term, document this behavior to make sure users are aware of the inherent risks of using validators in case of a compromise. Long term, consider monitoring the blockchain using the `SignatureValidatorApproval` events to catch front-running attacks.
2. Medium Risk severity finding from [ToBâ€™s Audit of 0x Protocol](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/0x-protocol.pdf)
