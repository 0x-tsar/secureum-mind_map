`swapExactTokensForETH` checks the wrong return value Instead of checking that the amount of tokens received from a swap is greater than the minimum amount expected from this swap, it calculates the difference between the initial receiverâ€™s balance and the balance of the router


1.  Recommendation: Check the intended values
2.  Major severity finding from [Consensys Diligence Audit of DAOfi](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/02/daofi/#the-swapexacttokensforeth-checks-the-wrong-return-value)
