# 85 - [Incorrect `safeApprove` usage](./Incorrect%20`safeApprove`%20usage.md)

The `safeApprove` function of the OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 library prevents changing an allowance between non-zero values to mitigate a possible front-running attack. 

Instead, the `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` functions should be used. 

However, the `UniERC20` library simply bypasses this restriction by first setting the allowance to zero. 

This reintroduces the front-running attack and undermines the value of the `safeApprove` function. 

Consider introducing an `increaseAllowance` function to handle this case.

### Recommendation:
`safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` functions should be used
