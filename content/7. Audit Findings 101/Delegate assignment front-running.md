# 33 - [Delegate assignment front-running](./Delegate%20assignment%20front-running.md)

 Any member can front-run another member’s `delegateKey` assignment. If you try to submit an address as your `delegateKey`, someone else can try to assign your delegate address to themselves. While incentive of this action is unclear, it’s possible to block some address from being a delegate forever.
