Queued transactions cannot be canceled The Governor contract contains special functions to set it as the admin of the `Timelock`. Only the admin can call `Timelock.cancelTransaction`. There are no functions in Governor that call `Timelock.cancelTransaction`. This makes it impossible for `Timelock.cancelTransaction` to ever be called.


1.  Recommendation: Short term, add a function to the Governor that calls _Timelock.cancelTransaction_. It is unclear who should be able to call it, and what other restrictions there should be around cancelling a transaction. Long term, consider letting Governor inherit from _Timelock_. This would allow a lot of functions and code to be removed and significantly lower the complexity of these two contracts.
2.  High Risk severity finding from [ToBâ€™s Audit of Origin Dollar](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/OriginDollar.pdf)
