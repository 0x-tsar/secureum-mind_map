# 48 - [Initialization functions can be front-run](./Initialization%20functions%20can%20be%20front-run.md)

`Hermez`, `HermezAuctionProtocol`, and `WithdrawalDelayer` have initialization functions that can be front-run, allowing an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contracts. Due to the use of the `delegatecall` proxy pattern, `Hermez`, `HermezAuctionProtocol`, and `WithdrawalDelayer` cannot be initialized with a constructor, and have initializer functions. 

All these functions can be front-run by an attacker, allowing them to initialize the contracts with malicious values.

### Recommendation:
Short term, either: 
	1. Use a factory pattern that will prevent front-running of the initialization, or 
	2. Ensure the deployment scripts are robust in case of a front-running attack. Carefully review the Solidity documentation, especially the Warnings section. Carefully review the pitfalls of using delegatecall proxy pattern.
