# 39 - [External calls in loop can lead to denial of service](./External%20calls%20in%20loop%20can%20lead%20to%20denial%20of%20service.md)

Several function calls are made in unbounded loops. 

This pattern is error-prone as it can trap the contracts due to the gas limitations or failed transactions.

### Recommendation:
Short term, review all the loops mentioned above and either: 
	1. allow iteration over part of the loop, or
	2. remove elements. Long term, subscribe to Crytic.io to review external calls in loops. Crytic catches bugs of this type.
