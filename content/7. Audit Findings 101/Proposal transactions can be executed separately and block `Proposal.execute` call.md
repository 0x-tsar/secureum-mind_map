Proposal transactions can be executed separately and block `Proposal.execute` call Missing access controls in the `Timelock.executeTransaction` function allow Proposal transactions to be executed separately, circumventing the `Governor.execute` function.


1.  Recommendation: Short term, only allow the admin to call _Timelock.executeTransaction_
2.  High Risk severity finding from [ToBâ€™s Audit of Origin Dollar](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/OriginDollar.pdf)
