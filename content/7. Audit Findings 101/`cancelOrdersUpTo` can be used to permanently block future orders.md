# 59 - [`cancelOrdersUpTo` can be used to permanently block future orders](./`cancelOrdersUpTo`%20can%20be%20used%20to%20permanently%20block%20future%20orders.md)

Users can cancel an arbitrary number of future orders, and this operation is not reversible. 

The `cancelOrdersUpTo` function (Figure 3.1) can cancel an arbitrary number of orders in a single, fixed-size transaction. 

his function uses a parameter to discard any order with salt less than the input value. 

However, `cancelOrdersUpTo` can cancel future orders if it is called with a very large value (e.g., `MAX_UINT256` - This operation will cancel future orders, except for the one with salt equal to `MAX_UINT256`.

### Recommendation:
Properly document this behavior to warn users about the permanent effects of `cancelOrderUpTo` on future orders. Alternatively, disallow the cancelation of future orders.
