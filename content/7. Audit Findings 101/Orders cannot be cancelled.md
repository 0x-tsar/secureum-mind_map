# 98 - [Orders cannot be cancelled](./Orders%20cannot%20be%20cancelled.md)

When a user or broker calls `cancelOrder`, the cancelled mapping is updated, but this has no subsequent effects. 

In particular, `validateOrderParam` does not check if the order has been cancelled.

### Recommendation:
Consider adding this check to the order validation to ensure cancelled orders cannot be filled.
