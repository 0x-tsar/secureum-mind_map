# 17 - [ERC20 tokens with no return value will fail to transfer](./ERC20%20tokens%20with%20no%20return%20value%20will%20fail%20to%20transfer.md)

Although the ERC20 standard suggests that a transfer should return true on success, many tokens are non-compliant in this regard. 

In that case, the `.transfer()` call here will revert even if the transfer is successful, because solidity will check that the `RETURNDATASIZE` matches the ERC20 interface.
### Recommendation:
Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20
