# 68 - [Improper Storage Management of Open Loan Accounts](./Improper%20Storage%20Management%20of%20Open%20Loan%20Accounts.md)

When loans are open, the associated account address gets added to the `accountsWithOpenLoans` array regardless of whether the account already has a loan/is already included in the array. 

Additionally, it is possible for a malicious actor to create a denial of service condition exploiting the unbound storage array in `accountsSynthLoans`.Â 

### Recommendation:
Consider changing the `storeLoan` function to only push the account to the `accountsWithOpenLoans` array if the loan to be stored is the first one for that particular account ; 2) Introduce a limit to the number of loans each account can have.
