# 37 - [Reentrancy and untrusted contract call in `mintMultiple`](./Reentrancy%20and%20untrusted%20contract%20call%20in%20`mintMultiple`.md)

Missing checks and no reentrancy prevention allow untrusted contracts to be called from `mintMultiple`. This could be used by an attacker to drain the contracts.

### Recommendation:
Short term, add checks that cause `mintMultiple` to revert if the amount is zero or the asset is not supported. Add a reentrancy guard to the `mint`, `mintMultiple`, `redeem`, and `redeemAll` functions. Long term, make use of Slither which will flag the reentrancy. Or even better, use Crytic and incorporate static analysis checks into your CI/CD pipeline. Add reentrancy guards to all non-view functions callable by anyone. Make sure to always revert a transaction if an input is incorrect. Disallow calling untrusted contracts.
