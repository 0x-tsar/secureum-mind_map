# 58 - [Assimilators use a deprecated Chainlink API](./Assimilators%20use%20a%20deprecated%20Chainlink%20API.md)

The old version of the Chainlink price feed API (`AggregatorInterface`) is used throughout the contracts and tests. 

For example, the deprecated function `latestAnswer` is used.

This function is not present in the latest API reference (`AggregatorInterfaceV3`). 

However, it is present in the deprecated API reference. 

In the worst-case scenario, the deprecated contract could cease to report the latest values, which would very likely cause liquidity providers to incur losses.

### Recommendation:
Use the latest stable versions of any external libraries or contracts leveraged by the codebase
