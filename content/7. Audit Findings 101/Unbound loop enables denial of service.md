# 51 - [Unbound loop enables denial of service](./Unbound%20loop%20enables%20denial%20of%20service.md)

The swap function relies on an unbounded loop. 

An attacker could disrupt swap operations by forcing the loop to go through too many operations, potentially trapping the swap due to a lack of gas.

### Recommendation:
Bound the loops and document the bounds.
