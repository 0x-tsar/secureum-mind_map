The system uses the same account to change both frequently updated parameters and those that require less frequent updates. 

This architecture is error-prone and increases the severity of any privileged account compromises.

### Recommendation:
Short term, use a separate account to handle updating the tokens/USD ratio. Using the same account for the critical operations and update the tokens/USD ratio increases underlying risks. Long term, document the access controls and set up a proper authorization architecture. Consider the risks associated with each access point and their frequency of usage to evaluate the proper design.
