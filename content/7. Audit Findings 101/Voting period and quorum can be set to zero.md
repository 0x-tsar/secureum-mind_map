# 92 - [Voting period and quorum can be set to zero](./Voting%20period%20and%20quorum%20can%20be%20set%20to%20zero.md)

When the Governance contract is initialized, the values of `votingPeriod` and `votingQuorum` are checked to make sure that they are greater than 0. 

However, the corresponding setter functions `setVotingPeriod` and setVotingQuorum allow these variables to be reset to 0. 

Setting the `votingPeriod` to zero would cause spurious proposals that cannot be voted. 

Setting the quorum to zero is worse because it would allow proposals with 0 votes to be executed.

### Recommendation:
Consider adding the validation to the setter functions
