# 36 - [Proposals could allow `Timelock.admin` takeover](./Proposals%20could%20allow%20`Timelock.admin`%20takeover.md)

The Governor contract contains special functions to let the guardian queue a transaction to change the `Timelock.admin`. 

However, a regular Proposal is also allowed to contain a transaction to change the `Timelock.admin`. 

This poses an unnecessary risk in that an attacker could create a Proposal to change the `Timelock.admin`.

### Recommendation:
Short term, add a check that prevents `setPendingAdmin` to be included in a Proposal
