# 94 - [Expired and/or paused options can still be traded](./Expired%20and/or%20paused%20options%20can%20still%20be%20traded.md)

 Option tokens can still be freely transferred when the Option contract is either paused or expired (or both). This would allow malicious option holders to sell paused / expired options that cannot be exercised in the open market to exchanges and users who do not take the necessary precautions before buying an option minted by the Primitive protocol.
