The flash-minting feature from the `fyDAI` token can be used to redeem an arbitrary amount of funds from a mature token.

### Recommendation:
Short term, disallow calls to redeem in the `YDai` and Unwind contracts during flash minting. Long term, do not include operations that allow any user to manipulate an arbitrary amount of funds, even if it is in a single transaction. This will prevent attackers from gaining leverage to manipulate the market and break internal invariants.
