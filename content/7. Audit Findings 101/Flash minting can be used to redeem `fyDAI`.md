Flash minting can be used to redeem `fyDAI` The flash-minting feature from the `fyDAI` token can be used to redeem an arbitrary amount of funds from a mature token.


1. Recommendation: Short term, disallow calls to redeem in the _YDai_ and Unwind contracts during flash minting. Long term, do not include operations that allow any user to manipulate an arbitrary amount of funds, even if it is in a single transaction. This will prevent attackers from gaining leverage to manipulate the market and break internal invariants.
2. Medium Risk severity finding from [ToBâ€™s Audit of Yield Protocol](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/YieldProtocol.pdf)
