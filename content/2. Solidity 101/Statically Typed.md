# 35 - [Statically Typed](Statically%20Typed.md)
[Solidity](Solidity.md) is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of each variable (state and local) needs to be specified in code at compile-time. 

This is unlike dynamically-typed languages where types are required only with runtime values. 

Statically-typed languages perform compile-time type-checking according to the language rules. 

Other examples are C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala.
