# 23 - [Function Visibility](Function%20Visibility.md)
Function Visibility Specifiers: [Functions](Functions.md) have to be specified as being `public`, `external`, `internal` or `private`:

1. `public`: Public functions are part of the contract interface and can be either called internally or via messages.Â 
    
2. `external`: External functions are part of the contract interface, which means they can be called from other contracts and via transactions. An external function f cannot be called internally (i.e. `f()` does not work, but `this.f()` works).
    
3. `internal`: Internal functions can only be accessed internally from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it
    
4. `private`: Private functions can only be accessed from the contract they are defined in and not even in derived contracts
