# 97 - [Programming Style](Programming%20Style.md)
Coding conventions for writing solidity code. Style is about consistency. 

Consistency with style is important. 

Consistency within a project is more important. 

Consistency within one module or function is most important. 

Two main categories: 

1. Layout 
2. Naming Conventions. 

Programming style affects readability and maintainability, both of which affect security.
