# 66 - [Shorthand Operators](Shorthand%20Operators.md)
perators Involving LValues (i.e. a variable or something that can be assigned to)

1. `a += e` is equivalent to `a = a + e`. The operators -=, *=, /=, %=, |=, &= and ^= are defined accordingly
    
2. `a++` and `a--` are equivalent to `a += 1` / `a -= 1` but the expression itself still has the previous value of a
    
3. In contrast, `--a` and `++a` have the same effect on a but return the value after the change

## Slide Deck
- LValues -> Assigned To
- `a += e` is `a = a + e`
-  `a++`/`a--` -> `a += 1` & `a -= 1`
-  `--a`/`++a` -> `a += 1` & `a -= 1`
-  Expr -> Modified Value
