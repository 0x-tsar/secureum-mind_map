# 11 - [Comments](Comments.md)
Single-line comments (`//`) and multi-line comments (`/*...*/`) are possible. 

Comments are recommended as in-line documentation of what contracts, functions, variables, expressions, control and data flow are expected to do as per the implementation, and any assumptions/invariants made/needed. 

They help in readability and maintainability.
