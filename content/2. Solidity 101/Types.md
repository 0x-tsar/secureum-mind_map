# 36 - [Types](Types.md)
Solidity has two categories of types: [Value Types](Value%20Type.md) and [Reference Types](Reference%20Type.md). 

- [Value Types](Value%20Type.md) are called so because variables of these types will always be passed by value, i.e. they are always copied when they are used as function arguments or in assignments. 

- In contrast, [Reference Types](Reference%20Type.md) can be modified through multiple different names i.e. references to the same underlying variable.
