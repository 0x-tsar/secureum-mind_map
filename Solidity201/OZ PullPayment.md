# 158 - [OZ PullPayment](OZ%20PullPayment.md)
OpenZeppelin PullPayment: provides a pull-payment strategy, where the paying contract doesnâ€™t invoke any functions on the receiver account which must withdraw its payments itself. 

Pull-payments are often considered the best practice when it comes to sending Ether, security-wise. 

It prevents recipients from blocking execution and eliminates reentrancy concerns.
