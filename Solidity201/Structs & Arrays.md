Storage Layout & Structs/Arrays:Â 
    
1. Structs and array data always start a new slot and their items are packed tightly according to these rules

2. Items following struct or array data always start a new storage slot

1. The elements of structs and arrays are stored after each other, just as if they were given as individual values.
