# 57 - [Arrays](Arrays.md)
Arrays can have a compile-time fixed size, or they can have a dynamic size

1.  The type of an array of fixed size k and element type T is written as `T[k]`, and an array of dynamic size as `T[]`.
   
2.  Indices are zero-based
    
3.  Array elements can be of any type, including mapping or struct.Â 
    
4.  Accessing an array past its end causes a failing assertion
