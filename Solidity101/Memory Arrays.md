# 60 - [Memory Arrays](Memory%20Arrays.md)
Memory arrays with dynamic length can be created using the `new` operator

1.  As opposed to storage arrays, it is not possible to resize memory arrays i.e. the `.push` member functions are not available
    
2.  You either have to calculate the required size in advance or create a new memory array and copy every element
