# 46 - Ethereum Node-Client

A **node** is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum nodes. 

A **client** is a specific implementation of Ethereum node. 

The two most common client implementations are Geth and OpenEthereum. 

Ethereum transactions are sent to Ethereum nodes to be broadcast across the peer-to-peer network.
