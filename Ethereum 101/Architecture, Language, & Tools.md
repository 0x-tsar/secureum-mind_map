# 94 - [[Architecture, Language, & Tools]]

New Architecture, Language & Toolchains: Ethereum has a new virtual machine ([[EVM]]) architecture which is a stack-based machine with 256-bit words and associated gas semantics. 

1.  Solidity language continues to dominate smart contracts without much real competition (except Vyper perhaps). 
    
2.  The associated toolchains which include development environments (e.g. Truffle, Brownie, Hardhat), libraries (e.g. OpenZeppelin), security tools (e.g. Slither, MythX, Securify) and wallets (e.g. Metamask) are maturing but still playing catch up to the exponential growth of the space.
