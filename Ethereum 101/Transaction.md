# 31 - Transaction

Transactions are signed messages originated by an externally owned account (EOA), transmitted by the Ethereum network, and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Only transactions can trigger a change of state. Ethereum is a transaction-based state machine. (See [here](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/06transactions.asciidoc))
