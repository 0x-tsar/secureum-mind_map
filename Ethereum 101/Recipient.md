# 37 - [[Recipient]]

The 20-byte Ethereum address of the transactionâ€™s recipient which can be an [[EOA]] or a [[Contract Account]].

1.  The Ethereum protocol does not validate recipient addresses in transactions. One can send a transaction to an address that has no corresponding private key or contract. Validation should be done at the user interface level.
    
2.  Note that there is no _from_ address in the transaction because the EOAâ€™s public key can be derived from the [[v, r, s]] components of the [[ECDSA]] signature and the transaction originatorâ€™s address can be derived from this public key
