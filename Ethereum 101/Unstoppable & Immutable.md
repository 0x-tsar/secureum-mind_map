# 92 - [[Unstoppable & Immutable]]

Unstoppable & Immutable: [[Web3]] applications, popularly known as Decentralized Applications ( [[Dapp]]s), are expected to be unstoppable and immutable because they run on a decentralized blockchain network. 

1.  There should not be any one entity that can unilaterally decide to stop a running  ÐApp or make changes to it. Transactions and data on the blockchain are guaranteed to be immutable unless a majority of the network decides otherwise. 
    
2.  Smart contracts, in general, are expected (by users) to not have kill switches controlled by deployers. They are also expected to not be arbitrarily upgradeable. Both these stem from the [[Web3]] goal of trust-minimization, i.e. lack of need to trust potentially malicious  ÐApp developers. However, this makes fixing security vulnerabilities in deployed code and responding to exploits very challenging.
