# 9 - More Core Components

1.  Consensus algorithm: Ethereum uses Bitcoin’s consensus model, Nakamoto Consensus, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by Proof-of-Work (PoW) to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. 
2.  However, this is being transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm in Ethereum 2.0.
3.  Economic security: Ethereum currently uses a PoW algorithm called Ethash, but this is being transitioned to a PoS algorithm in [[ETH 2.0]].
4.  Clients: Ethereum has several interoperable implementations of the client software, the most prominent of which are Go-Ethereum (Geth) and OpenEthereum. The others are Erigon, Nethermind and Turbo-geth. OpenEthereum is being deprecated to transition to Erigon, which is the former Turbo-geth.
