# 2 - Turing Complete

Ethereum is a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. (See [here](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/))
