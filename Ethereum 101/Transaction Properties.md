# 32 - [[Transaction Properties]]

Transaction properties:

1.  Atomic: it is all or nothing i.e. cannot be divided or interrupted by other transactions
2.  Serial: Transactions are processed sequentially one after the other without any overlapping by other transactions
3.  Inclusion: Transaction inclusion is not guaranteed and depends on network congestion and gasPrice among other things. Miners determine inclusion.
4.  Order: Transaction order is not guaranteed and depends on network congestion and gasPrice among other things. Miners determine order.
