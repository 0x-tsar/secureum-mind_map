# 42 - [[Contract Creation]]

Contract creation transactions are sent to a special destination address called the zero address i.e. `0x0`. 

A contract creation transaction contains a data payload with the compiled bytecode to create the contract. 

An optional ether amount in the [[Value]] field will create the new contract with a starting balance.
