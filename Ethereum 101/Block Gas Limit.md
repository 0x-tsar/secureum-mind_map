# 48 - [[Block Gas Limit]]

[[Block]] gas limit is set by miners and refers to the cap on the total amount of gas expended by all transactions in the block, which ensures that blocks canâ€™t be arbitrarily large. 

Blocks therefore are not a fixed size in terms of the number of transactions because different transactions consume different amounts of gas.
