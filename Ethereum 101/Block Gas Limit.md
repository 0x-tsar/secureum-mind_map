# 48 - Block Gas Limit

Block gas limit is set by miners and refers to the cap on the total amount of gas expended by all transactions in the block, which ensures that blocks canâ€™t be arbitrarily large. 

Blocks therefore are not a fixed size in terms of the number of transactions because different transactions consume different amounts of gas. See [here](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit) for historical block gas limits.
